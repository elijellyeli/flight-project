## Overview

This is my final project submission for the Data Engineer Zoomcamp Course. It aims to build an end-to-end orchestrated data pipeline, using technologies such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Docker, Python programming, DBT, and more.

For my project, I decided to explore arrival & departure flight patterns, specifically from Israel's Ben Gurion Airport (airport code LLBG). I've used a free API by OpenSky Network that has the ability to query by the airport and a given timeframe. Another data source I've used is airport & airline info from OpenFlights, to cross-reference the data and get more info such as origin country, airline name, etc.

The Flight data is queried daily, saved the result in a Parquet file on Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and pulled to BigQuery Data-Warehouse. Then, with the help of DBT, models (SQL tables) are built on top of these files - first staging models, and then core models ready for consumption. Finally, I've created a dashboard in Power BI with two tiles in order to investigate the patterns in a graphical manner - with bar charts, maps, and timelines.


## Business Questions

1. How many flights are arriving/departing from LLBG?
2. What are the top airlines that fly into/out of LLBG?
3. From which countries are the arrivals/departures coming?
4. How long, on average, are these flights?
5. What is the difference on a monthly level of all these questions above?

## Technologies

* Container Development: `Docker`
* Cloud: `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)`
* Data Lake: `Google Cloud Storage (GCS)`
* Data Transformation: `DBT`

* Orchestration Tool: `Mage AI`
* Data Visualization: `Power BI`
* Programing Langues: `SQL & Python`

## Architecture

## Steps

This project is meant to demonstrate the end-to-end flow of data from raw files & api calls to a dashboard:

* Extract the data from the API on a daily basis and the raw files as well, in an orchestration tool (Mage AI) in an automated manner.
* Ingest the API data by loading transformed parquet files into a GCS bucket.
* Load external files into a BigQuery Data Warehouse, and transform the data using DBT - creating staging & core models.
* Connect the final models (SQL tables) into a Power BI Dashboard, and investigate the data to extract insights.

## Dataset

Here is the final fact_flights information table, one of the final core models:

Table is optimized by:

* Partitioned on the `first_seen` column (on a daily level) to allow for efficient data filtering based on specific date ranges.
* Clustered on the `flight_type`, `dep_airport_country`, `arr_airport_country` columns to improve query performance and data locality.

## What's Next?

Next steps can be:

1. Adding more cross reference data such as data on countries or other sources
2. Implementing IaC logic such as Terraform - to create a Project, buckets and other resources easily with a command
3. Creating a Compute Instance on google and pushing the Docker Image to run in the cloud, instead of locally.
4. Move the creation of the static Airport/Airline CSV to a Mage Pipeline for easier running.
